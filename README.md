### Visualizing Population Distribution using Bar Chart/Histogram

This project visualizes the distribution of a chosen variable, such as age or gender, in a population using a sample dataset from the World Bank. The following steps were completed:

1. **Dataset Collection:** Downloaded the population dataset from the World Bank website [here](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL).
2. **Data Cleaning:** Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset for analysis.
3. **Visualization:** Created a bar chart/histogram using Matplotlib/Seaborn to visualize the distribution of the selected variable.
4. **Analysis:** Provided a brief analysis of the visualized data.
